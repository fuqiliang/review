### Semi Structured Data

There are two basic points that this class of work exemplifies.
1) schema last
2) complex network-oriented data model

In this class of proposals the schema does not need to be specified in advance. It can be
specified last, or even not at all. In a “schema last” system, data instances must be selfdescribing, because there is not necessarily a schema to give meaning to incoming
records. Without a self-describing format, a record is merely “a bucket of bits”.

To make a record self-describing, one must tag each attribute with metadata that defines
the meaning of the attribute.
