# A Banksy painting sold at auction for $1.4 million - then automatically shredded itself

Anonymous British griffiti artist Branksy has pulled off another stunt that seized the attention of the art world - this time at the expense of his own work.

On Friday, a Branksy paiting titled "Girl With Red Ballon" was being auctioned at Sothebey's in London. The biting climbed to an extraordinary $1.4 billion , an amount that tied the artist's own record from 2008. Finally, a hamer pounded  to signify the end of the auction.

Right then, the paiting's canvas began moving downward, seeming to pass through its elaborate glided frame - and reappearing below in neat , vertical strips. Later,  Sothebey's would explain that a shredder was hidden inside the frame.

"It appears we just got Branksy-ed ," Sothebey's senior director Alex Branczik said in a statement that describe the incident as " the first time in auction history that the work of art automatically shred itself after coming under the hammer". He told the outlet , "we are busing figuring out what it means in an auction context. The shred now is a part of the integral art work."

Branksy later posted a video to Instagram that showed footage of a shredding mechanism being build into the frame. "A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting," he stated in the video text, "in case it is ever put up into an auction". The video then jumped to clips of the  Friday's auction of Sothebey's, indicating that Branksy - or someone who works with him was there when it happened.

"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge," Branksy captioned the Instagram post.
