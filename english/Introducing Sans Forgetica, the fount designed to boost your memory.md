Psychology and design researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne created a font called Sans Forgetica, which was designed to boost information retention for readers. It is based on a theory called "desirable difficulty " which suggests that people remember things better when their brains have to overcome some minor obstacles while processing informations. Sans Forgetica is sleek and back-slanted with **intermittent** gaps in each letter , serve as a simple "puzzle" for the reader, according to Stepen Banhan, an RMIT lecture who helped to create the font.

The team tested the font's efficacy along with other intentionally complicated fonts on 400 students in lab and online experiments and found that "Sans Forgetica broke just enough priciples without being too eligible and aided memory retention", according to  a news release on the university's website.

In some ways, Sans Forgetica is continuation of work by Daniel Oppenheimer, a Carnegie Mellon psychology professor. Oppenheimer's team conducted a study at high school in Chesterfield, Ohio. The team changed the fonts on teaching materials - handouts, ppt and work-sheets -in several classed and subjects to common ones. After several weeks of instructions, researchers found that in all subjects except chemistry, students who have read tougher materials perform far better on the assignments. "This research shows behavioral intervention can be an important  element in school reform".
